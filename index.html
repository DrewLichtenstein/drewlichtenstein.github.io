    <p id="intro_card">I am a professional project manager and instructional designer, having worked with nearly a dozen Harvard faculty to bring their online courses to over a million learners. Additionally, I have extensive knowledge of front-end web design, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as having worked closely with graphic designers and video editors to help visualize and bring to life academic content.</p>

    <h2>Justice</h2>

    <p>I lead the redesign for world renowned philosopher Michael Sandel's <i>Justice</i>, a course that has enrolled hundreds of thousands of learners on edX. Under my stewardship, the course was updated with interactive tools, animated moral dilemmas, new assessments, and translations in five different languages.</p>

<h2>PredictionX</h2>

<p>I am the project lead for Professor Alyssa Goodman's <i>PredictionX</i>, a project that looks at human attempts to divine the future from ancient religions to modern computer simulations. To date, we have collaborated with nearly 30 experts from Harvard and beyond to create three edX modules, an open website, and an on-campus courae at Harvard.</p>

<h2> CitiesX </h2>

<p> I was the lead producer for one of HarvardX's largest projects yet -- a course adapation of Professor Edward Glaeser's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-City-Greatest-Invention-Healthier/dp/0143120549">best selling book about cities</a>, which includes over 160 videos, including location shoots in Brazil and England. I worked with a fellow HarvardX project to lead to oversee the pre-production, filming logistics, post-production editing, and implementation of the course on edX -- we completed this massive project under time and videos at an exceptionally high quality for the number we needed to produce. </p>

          <p>With my colleagues, I was awarded a $15,000 HILT Spark Grant in which we studied faculty's experiences teaching online; our results show that faculty who teach online find that it makes them feel like a better teacher in general, both for the online audience and their on-campus students. </p>
